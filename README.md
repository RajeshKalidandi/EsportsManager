## Environment Setup

This project uses environment variables to manage sensitive information. To set up your local environment:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` in the root directory.
2. Replace the placeholder values in `.env` with your actual Firebase configuration.
3. Never commit your `.env` file to the repository.

For deployment, ensure you set up these environment variables in your hosting platform.
